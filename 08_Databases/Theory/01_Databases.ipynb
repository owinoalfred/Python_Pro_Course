    "## 1. Introduction to Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Databases are essential for modern applications, enabling efficient data storage, retrieval, and management.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- Data persistence\n",
    "- Structured vs. unstructured data\n",
    "- Database Management Systems (DBMS)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Relational Databases & SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases store data in tables with rows and columns. SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to manage and query relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Topics:**\n",
    "- Tables, rows, columns\n",
    "- Primary and foreign keys\n",
    "- SQL basics: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE\n",
    "- Joins, aggregations, subqueries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Popular Systems:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. NoSQL Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are designed for flexible, scalable storage of unstructured or semi-structured data. Types include:\n",
    "- Document stores (MongoDB)\n",
    "- Key-value stores (Redis)\n",
    "- Column-family stores (Cassandra)\n",
    "- Graph databases (Neo4j)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use NoSQL:**\n",
    "- Large-scale, distributed systems\n",
    "- Flexible or evolving schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Data Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Data modeling is the process of designing the structure of a database. It involves:\n",
    "- Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams\n",
    "- Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)\n",
    "- Denormalization for performance\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Transactions & ACID Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. ACID properties ensure reliability:\n",
    "- **Atomicity**: All or nothing\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Valid state transitions\n",
    "- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions do not interfere\n",
    "- **Durability**: Results persist after completion\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Indexing & Query Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes speed up data retrieval. Query optimization ensures efficient execution.\n",
    "- Types: B-tree, hash, composite indexes\n",
    "- Analyzing query plans\n",
    "- Avoiding full table scans\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Database Security & Backup\n",
    "\n",
    "Protecting data is critical:\n",
    "- User authentication and authorization\n",
    "- Encryption (at rest and in transit)\n",
    "- Regular backups and disaster recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Best Practices & Real-World Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use appropriate data types\n",
    "- Avoid redundant data\n",
    "- Monitor performance\n",
    "- Real-world examples: e-commerce, banking, social media\n",
