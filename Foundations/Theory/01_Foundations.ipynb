    "## 1. Introduction to Programming Foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming foundations are the core principles and concepts that underpin all software development. They include understanding how computers process information, how to structure code, and how to approach problem solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- Syntax and semantics\n",
    "- Variables and data types\n",
    "- Control flow (if, for, while)\n",
    "- Functions and modularity\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Algorithms and Problem Solving\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems. Effective problem solving involves:\n",
    "- Breaking down complex problems\n",
    "- Designing efficient algorithms\n",
    "- Testing and debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Algorithm Types:**\n",
    "- Searching (linear, binary)\n",
    "- Sorting (bubble, merge, quicksort)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Core Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structures organize and store data efficiently. Key structures include:\n",
    "- Arrays and lists\n",
    "- Stacks and queues\n",
    "- Dictionaries (hash maps)\n",
    "- Trees and graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Computational Thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational thinking is a problem-solving process that includes:\n",
    "- Decomposition: Breaking problems into smaller parts\n",
    "- Pattern recognition: Finding similarities\n",
    "- Abstraction: Focusing on important details\n",
    "- Algorithm design: Creating step-by-step solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the efficiency of algorithms is crucial. Big O notation describes the worst-case performance:\n",
    "- O(1): Constant time\n",
    "- O(n): Linear time\n",
    "- O(log n): Logarithmic time\n",
    "- O(n^2): Quadratic time\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Recursion and Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a problem. Iteration uses loops. Both are fundamental for many algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- Factorial (recursive and iterative)\n",
    "- Fibonacci sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Best Practices and Mindset\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write clear, readable code\n",
    "- Test and debug thoroughly\n",
    "- Embrace continuous learning\n",
    "- Collaborate and seek feedback\n",
