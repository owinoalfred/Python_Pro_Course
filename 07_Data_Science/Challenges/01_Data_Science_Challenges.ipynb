    "\n",
    "You are given a dataset with missing values, inconsistent formatting, and duplicate records. Clean the data so it is ready for analysis. Document your process and justify your choices.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform a comprehensive EDA on a new dataset (e.g., Titanic, Wine Quality, or any open dataset). Identify key patterns, trends, and anomalies. Summarize your findings with visualizations and narrative.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 3. Feature Engineering Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Create new features from an existing dataset that could improve the performance of a machine learning model. Explain your reasoning and evaluate the impact of your engineered features.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Machine Learning Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Build and evaluate a machine learning model (classification or regression) on a real-world dataset. Compare at least two different algorithms and discuss their strengths and weaknesses in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Model Interpretation Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpret the results of your machine learning model. Use techniques such as feature importance, SHAP values, or partial dependence plots to explain how your model makes predictions. Discuss the implications for stakeholders.\n",
