    "**Question:** Tell me about a time you overcame a significant challenge at work.\n",

    "**Model Answer (STAR):**\n",
    "- **Situation:** In my previous job, our team faced a tight deadline for a major product release.\n",
    "- **Task:** As the lead developer, I was responsible for coordinating the team and ensuring on-time delivery.\n",
    "- **Action:** I organized daily stand-ups, delegated tasks based on strengths, and implemented a kanban board for transparency.\n",
    "- **Result:** We delivered the product on time, and it was well received by users.\n",

    "**Question:** Design a URL shortening service (like bit.ly).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach:**\n",
    "- Use a hash function to generate short codes for URLs\n",
    "- Store mappings in a database\n",
    "- Handle collisions and scalability\n",
    "- Discuss API endpoints for shortening and redirecting\n",
